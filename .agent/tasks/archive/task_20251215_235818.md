<acceptance_criteria>
  - [x] Upload API returns signed URLs with size/mime validation and PII classification metadata
  - [x] Evidence step uploads files via signed URLs and stores metadata in form state
  - [x] Allowed file types/sizes surfaced to users with clear errors; non-compliant uploads blocked
  - [x] Validators updated with typed evidence items; tests adjusted accordingly
</acceptance_criteria>
```
