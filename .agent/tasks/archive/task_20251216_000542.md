# 🚀 Current Task: Persist evidence metadata

## 📋 10x Context Prompt

Copy the block below to your Agent to start with maximum context:

```xml
<task_definition>
  <objective>Persist evidence metadata</objective>
  <type>Feature</type>
  <priority>P1-High</priority>
  <estimate>1d</estimate>
  <branch>feat/storage-pii-hygiene</branch>
  <constraints>
    - Use @interdomestik/ui components
    - Follow 10x-coding rules (Explore → Plan → Execute)
    - Mobile-first approach
    - Use next-intl for i18n
    - Write tests as specified in testing checklist
</constraints>
</task_definition>

<user_story>
  As a member submitting a claim, I want my uploaded evidence saved with metadata
  so that agents can securely review my documents and track them per claim.
</user_story>
<acceptance_criteria>
  - [x] Claim submission persists evidence metadata (path, size, type, bucket, user) into claim_documents linked to the claim
  - [x] Submissions work with or without evidence; invalid metadata fails fast
  - [x] Evidence schema/types updated and covered by unit tests
</acceptance_criteria>
```
