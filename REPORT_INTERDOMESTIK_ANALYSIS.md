**Date:** December 15, 2025
**Analyst:** Antigravity Agent

## 1. Executive Summary
The existing site (`interdomestik.com`) functions as a lead-generation brochure, prioritizing immediate phone contact for manual service. The new V2 platform is a digital self-service web application. The core opportunity lies in migrating the **Trust**, **Authority**, and **Persuasive Content** from the old site into the **Functional** framework of V2.

## 2. Component Analysis

### A. Value Proposition
| Component | Old Site (`interdomestik.com`) | New Platform (V2) | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headline** | "Aktivizoni Asistentin Tuaj!" (Activate Your Assistant) | "Modern Claim Management" (Generic) | V2 lacks the urgency and personal "Assistant" branding. |
| **Promise** | "Me Lehtë Është Bashkë" (Easier Together) | Efficient SaaS workflow. | V2 feels transactional, not relational/supportive. |
| **Offering** | "Free Consultation", "Legal Basis Determination" | "Dashboard", "New Claim" | V2 assumes the user assumes the service is paid/premium. |

### B. User Journey & Call to Action (CTA)
| Flow | Old Site | New Platform | Comparison |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary CTA** | **Call 049 900 600** (Phone) | **Register / Login** (Digital) | V2 hides the human support element completely. |
| **Secondary CTA** | Visit Office / WhatsApp | View Pricing | V2 introduces "Pricing" which might deter users expecting "Free Consulting". |
| **Engagement** | Passive Reading -> Phone Call | Active Account Creation -> Wizard | V2 requires higher user effort/trust upfront. |

### C. Visual Identity & Trust
*   **Old Site**: Deep Blue branding. Heavy use of "Medals/Badges" (1, 2, 3 steps) and imagery of safe/happy families.
*   **New V2**: Minimalist White/Gray/Green. Looks like a generic admin panel. Lacks emotional connection (safety, relief).

## 3. Key Findings

1.  **Missing "Human" Element**: The old site emphasizes that you are getting an *assistant* and *mediation*. V2 feels like you are just using software. The "Call 049 900 600" is a critical trust anchor that is missing in V2.
2.  **Service Specificity**: The old site explicitly lists "Physical Injury", "Car Accidents", etc. V2 groups everything under a generic "Claim" umbrella until you get deep into the wizard.
3.  **"Free" vs "SaaS"**: The old site advertises "Free Consulting" (Falas). V2 has a "Pricing" page. This is a potential conflict in business model perception.

## 4. Recommendations for V2

1.  **Hybrid Footer**: Permanently embed the "Call Center" info (Phone/WhatsApp) in the V2 footer to reassure users that help is available.
2.  **Landing Page Retrofit**: Rewrite the V2 Landing Page hero section to use the "Activate Your Assistant" messaging.
3.  **"Free Consultation" Badge**: If the business model allows, add a "Free Initial Assessment" badge to the Claim Wizard start screen to lower the barrier to entry.
4.  **Service Icons**: Replace generic icons with the specific "Car", "Health", "Home" iconography from the original brand identity.
