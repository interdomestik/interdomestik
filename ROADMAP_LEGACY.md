## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Quality gates per phase**: lint + unit + Playwright smoke (claim create/list/detail/dashboard) + a11y/perf spot-check before closing milestones.
2. **Stripe v20 hardening**: finalize product IDs in env/`PLANS`, webhook signature verification + idempotency keys, and customer portal smoke tests.
3. **Auth/route safety**: verify protected routes (app/[locale]/(app) vs (auth)), role guards for admin/agent, and session handling.
4. **i18n robustness**: locale-safe hydration (avoid drift), translation completeness checks per release with next-intl 4.
5. **Storage/PII hygiene**: signed URLs, mime/virus validation on uploads, data classification for documents.
6. **Notifications (Novu)**: delivery observability/logs, template versioning, and channel fallback strategy.
7. **Performance budgets**: bundle-size budget, image optimization, and Lighthouse/AXE passes during Phase 4 optimization.
8. **Error monitoring**: integrate Sentry (Next.js SDK server/client, source maps, tunnel/CSP as needed) with env wiring.
9. **Database security**: enforce RLS across app tables (claims, messages, documents, subscriptions, users), role-based policies, and server-only service-role usage.
10. **Feature flags/experimentation**: plan GrowthBook (MIT) rollout for controlled rollouts and A/B tests.
11. **Search**: plan Meilisearch (MIT) for fast search (claims, knowledge base, company directory).
12. **Analytics (self-host)**: plan PostHog/OpenTelemetry stack for product events without external PII leakage.
13. **Performance & mobile polish**: route-level Suspense/streaming, skeletons, image audit (Next/Image, AVIF/WebP), bundle diet (code-splitting/dynamic imports), mobile-first nav (bottom/tab), touch targets, offline-lite cache for shell/claims list/detail, pagination/infinite scroll on claims list, Supabase indexes (status/category/userId), and hydration-safe UI patterns for Radix (mount-gated portals).
14. **Web Vitals & observability**: report FCP/LCP/CLS to monitoring (e.g., Sentry) and add synthetic smoke (Playwright mobile viewport) for login/claim create/list/detail.

### Prime Claims Experience (Q-next, UX/Marketing uplift)

- Homepage trust/conversion: hero (“Start your claim in minutes”), claim-specific services grid (vehicle/property/injury), trust strip, 24/7 contact.
- Footer safety net: tap-to-call, WhatsApp, address/hours, reassurance line.
- Guided wizard: category tooltips, evidence prompts (photos/docs), privacy badge, SLA microcopy.
- `/services` page: What we solve → How it works → What you get → FAQ → Contact; “Speed & Safety” panel (intake <5 min, response <24h, secure uploads, escalation path).
- Experiments (flagged): flight-delay tile; “call me now” microform for high-intent accident/property traffic.

---

### Regionalization Track (Kosovo-first, then Balkans)

- Kosovo hardening: sq/en, local contact (phone/WhatsApp/address/hours), consent/privacy copy aligned; keep No Win/No Fee and <24h response where upheld.
- i18n completeness: add sr/mk locales; enforce translation completeness checks per release.
- Market flags/config: per-country eligibility text, SLAs, and optional category toggles (e.g., flight delay) via feature flags.
- Trust anchors per market: publish local contact points; clarify “claim adjuster (no emergency services)”.
- Data/PII hygiene: signed URLs, mime/virus scan, secure uploads standard across markets.
- Analytics by locale: segment funnels and completion to tune prompts/copy per country.
