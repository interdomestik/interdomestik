      "overview": "### Summary\n\nesbuild allows any websites to send any request to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings.\n\n### Details\n\nesbuild sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all requests, including the SSE connection, which allows any websites to send any request to the development server and read the response.\n\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/df815ac27b84f8b34374c9182a93c94718f8a630/pkg/api/serve_other.go#L121\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/df815ac27b84f8b34374c9182a93c94718f8a630/pkg/api/serve_other.go#L363\n\n**Attack scenario**:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18561484/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js').then(r => r.text()).then(content => console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region input field to an invalid value. Per the AWS shared responsibility model, customer applications should protect instances appropriately, or implement proper input sanitization checks. The AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 reached end-of-support on September 8, 2025, but a defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented in AWS SDK for JavaScript v3. Please migrate to that version.\n\nImpact\nCustomer applications could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK itself is functioning as designed, we recommend customers migrate to AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 for continued support and enhanced security features.\n\nImpacted versions: All versions of AWS SDK for JavaScript v2\n\nPatches\nNo security patch is required, this is an informational advisory.\n\nWorkarounds\n- Implement proper input sanitization in your application code\n- Migrate to AWS SDK for JavaScript v3\n- Follow AWS security best practices for SDK configuration\n\nReferences\nContact AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\nAcknowledgement\nAWS Security thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to our attention through the coordinated disclosure process.",

      "overview": "### Summary\n\nCross-client response data leak when a single `McpServer`/`Server` and transport instance is reused across multiple client connections, most commonly in stateless `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` deployments.\n\n### Impact\n\n**Who is affected:** Any MCP server deployment using the TypeScript SDK where a single `McpServer` (or `Server`) instance is shared across multiple concurrent client connections. This is most likely in stateless mode (no `sessionIdGenerator`), where the natural but incorrect pattern is to create one server and transport and handle all requests through it. Stateful mode is also affected if the server instance is improperly shared across sessions, though this misconfiguration is less common since the stateful pattern naturally encourages per-session instances.\n\n**What happens:** When two or more MCP clients send requests concurrently through a shared server instance, JSON-RPC message ID collisions cause responses to be routed to the wrong client's HTTP connection. Client A can receive response data intended for Client B, and vice versa, even when authorization was correctly enforced on each individual request.\n\nThe MCP SDK's client generates message IDs using a simple incrementing counter starting at 0. When two clients connect to the same server instance, they produce identical message IDs, causing the transport's internal request-to-stream mapping to overwrite one client's entry with another's — routing responses to the wrong HTTP connection.\n\n**Conditions for exploitation:**\n- The server reuses a single `McpServer`/`Server` instance across requests or sessions (rather than creating fresh instances per request/session)\n- Two or more clients connect concurrently\n- Clients generate overlapping JSON-RPC message IDs (virtually guaranteed since the SDK's client uses an incrementing counter starting at 0)\n\n**Not affected:**\n- Stateful servers that create a new `McpServer` + transport per session (the typical and recommended stateful pattern)\n- Stateless servers that create a new `McpServer` + transport per request\n- Single-client environments (e.g., local development with one IDE)\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix adds runtime guards that turn silent data misrouting into immediate, actionable errors:\n\n1. `Protocol.connect()` now throws if the protocol is already connected to a transport, preventing silent transport overwriting across both stateful and stateless modes\n2. Stateless `StreamableHTTPServerTransport.handleRequest()` now throws if called more than once, enforcing one-request-per-transport in stateless mode\n\nServers that were incorrectly reusing instances will now receive a clear error message directing them to create separate instances per connection.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf projects cannot upgrade immediately, ensure the server creates fresh `McpServer` and transport instances for each request (stateless) or session (stateful):\n\n```typescript\n// Stateless mode: create new server + transport per request\napp.post('/mcp', async (req, res) => {\n  const server = new McpServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });\n  // ... register tools, resources, etc.\n  const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({ sessionIdGenerator: undefined });\n  await server.connect(transport);\n  await transport.handleRequest(req, res);\n});\n\n// Stateful mode: create new server + transport per session\nconst sessions = new Map();\napp.post('/mcp', async (req, res) => {\n  const sessionId = req.headers['mcp-session-id'];\n  if (sessions.has(sessionId)) {\n    await sessions.get(sessionId).transport.handleRequest(req, res);\n  } else {\n    const server = new McpServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });\n    // ... register tools, resources, etc.\n    const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({\n      sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID()\n    });\n    await server.connect(transport);\n    sessions.set(transport.sessionId, { server, transport });\n    await transport.handleRequest(req, res);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Resources\n\n- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/204\n- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/243",
