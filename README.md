# 🛡️ Interdomestik V3

The #1 Consumer Protection & Claims Management Platform in the Balkans.

## 📋 Overview

Interdomestik is a subscription-based consumer protection service that helps members resolve disputes with companies, landlords, insurance providers, employers, and other entities. **Version 3 (V3)** represents our latest architectural evolution, featuring specific domain isolation, proxy-based routing, and enhanced multi-tenant security.

## 🔐 Authentication Architecture (V3)

Authentication in Interdomestik V3 is **intentionally abstracted and in transition**.

- **Supabase Auth** remains the system of record for identities and sessions.
- **better-auth** is used as the active authentication orchestrator.
- **`@interdomestik/shared-auth`** provides a provider-agnostic boundary layer, allowing the system to evolve without coupling business logic to a single auth vendor.

This design is deliberate and supports future authentication flexibility without disrupting the V3 pilot.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- **pnpm** 10+ (Required)
- Supabase CLI (for local DB)
- Docker (optional, for SonarQube/local services)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/interdomestik/interdomestik.git
   cd interdomestik
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Populate .env.local with credentials (SUPABASE_URL, PADDLE_KEYS, etc.)
   ```

### Development Boot

We use **Boot Scripts** to standardize startup:

```bash
#  🚀 Start Full Stack (Database + Next.js)
pnpm boot:dev

#  🧪 Prepare for E2E (Seeds database + setup)
pnpm boot:e2e
```

## 📍 Canonical Routes & Portals

V3 uses strict **Canonical Routes**. All access is governed by `apps/web/src/proxy.ts`.

| Role       | Canonical Path    | Description                 |
| :--------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Member** | `/member`         | Dashboard, Claims, Settings |
| **Agent**  | `/agent/members`  | Agent Portal & Member Mgmt  |
| **Staff**  | `/staff/claims`   | Staff Operations Queue      |
| **Admin**  | `/admin/overview` | Executive Cockpit           |

> **Note:** Legacy middleware is no longer the primary routing authority. All canonical routing, access control, and tenant isolation are enforced in `src/proxy.ts`.

## ✅ Pilot Readiness & Quality Gates

> **V3 Pilot Scope**
> This repository is currently in Phase C (Pilot Delivery).
> Architecture, routing, clarity markers, and security guards are locked.
> Feature completeness is being finalized through explicit pilot workflows.

We enforce strict quality standards ("The Guard") for the V3 Pilot.

### Verification (The Standard)

Before pushing _any_ code, run the verifier:

```bash
pnpm pr:verify
```

_Runs: Format check, Lint, Type-check, and Web Smoke Tests._

### Security

We use an automated security guard to prevent sensitive leaks and unsafe patterns:

```bash
pnpm security:guard
```

### Testing (Playwright + Vitest)

- **Unit Tests**: `pnpm test` (Web) or `pnpm test:unit:domains` (Domains)
- **E2E Gate**: `pnpm e2e:gate` (Strict quality gate)
- **Clarity Markers**: used in E2E tests to verify V3 surface readiness.

## 🌍 Internationalization

Supported Locales:

- 🇦🇱 **SQ** (Albanian) - Primary
- 🇬🇧 **EN** (English)
- 🇲🇰 **MK** (Macedonian)
- 🇷🇸 **SR** (Serbian)
- 🇩🇪 **DE** (German)
- 🇭🇷 **HR** (Croatian)

Updates to translations should be made in `apps/web/src/messages/{locale}/`.

## 📦 Database & Drizzle

We use **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database interactions.

```bash
# Push schema changes (Local)
pnpm db:push:local

# Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:studio
```
